In this notebook, My aim is  to predict the future prices of Ethereum using historical data from 2018 to 2024.
The model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly 
effective for time series forecasting tasks
like stock and cryptocurrency price predictions. By analyzing the closing prices, the model attempts to forecast the price for the next 60 days.
